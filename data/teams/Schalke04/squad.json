  "explanation": "The 2011 DFB‐Pokal Final stands as one of Schalke 04’s most iconic evenings – a day when the club not only secured its fifth major trophy but also showcased a masterclass in teamwork and tactical discipline under coach Ralf Rangnick. Featuring a blend of seasoned campaigners (Ralf Fährmann, Hans Sarpei, Jeffrey Bruma, and Marius Ebbers), energetic midfield generals (Sebastian Kehl and Jermaine Jones) and a potent attacking unit led by Klaas‐Jan Huntelaar – with creative contributions from Christoph Moritz and the ever‐influential Gerald Asamoah – this lineup represents the moment when Schalke performed at its peak. The substitutes, including a young Julian Draxler, Sören Brandy, Erwin Hoffer and Cuneyt Demir, further underscore the depth of quality present that day. Every one of these players took to the field together in that final, etching an indelible mark on the club’s history."
