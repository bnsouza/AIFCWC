  "explanation": "This lineup is considered Ba FC’s best-ever as it was fielded during the 2008 OFC Champions League Final – a match that remains the pinnacle of the club’s history. In that game, Ba FC secured international acclaim by defeating a tough Waitakere United side. The team’s 4-3-3 formation provided a perfect balance: a sturdy defensive line anchored by two goalkeepers and center-backs who had shared pitch duties during the season, a midfield that combined the creative genius of Roy Krishna and Manasa Qio with the disciplined protection of Ratu Satala, and an attacking trio led by the clinical Timoci Damu. The substitutes, all of whom featured in official matches that season, rounded out a squad that performed as a cohesive unit at its peak."
