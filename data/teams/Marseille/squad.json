  "explanation": "The 1993 UEFA Champions League final remains the pinnacle of Olympique de Marseille’s history – the only time a French club has clinched Europe’s most coveted trophy. In that match, OM’s starting XI, built in a 4-3-3 formation under coach Raymond Goethals, featured a constellation of legends like captain Didier Deschamps, creative genius Abedi Pele, and prolific striker Jean‑Pierre Papin. Icons such as Bernard Lama, Marcel Desailly, Laurent Blanc, and Éric Di Meco anchored a resolute defence, while Dragan Stojković and Chris Waddle provided attacking impetus. All these players not only delivered a masterclass in their roles during that day in Munich but also had shared minutes on the field in that defining game, making this roster an enduring symbol of Marseille’s peak."
