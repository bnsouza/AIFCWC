  "explanation": "The 2007 CONCACAF Champions League Final stands out as one of Pachuca’s most significant matches, marking the club’s peak on the international stage. Under coach Enrique Meza’s guidance and using a 4-2-3-1 formation, this lineup combined defensive solidity, midfield resilience, and lethal attacking ability. Every player listed – from the starting XI to key substitutes – took the field together in that decisive final, and their collective performance helped cement Pachuca’s status as one of CONCACAF’s elite clubs. This historical team not only brought home a major trophy but also defined an era of success and attractive football for the club."
