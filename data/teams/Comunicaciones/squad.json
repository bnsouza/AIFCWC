  "explanation": "This lineup represents the peak of Comunicaciones' performance during the 2015 Apertura Championship final—a match widely regarded as one of the club’s most significant victories. In that game, Comunicaciones defeated their fierce rivals Municipal with a commanding 4-3-3 formation that combined a rock-solid defense, a creative and hardworking midfield, and an incisive attack spearheaded by national icon Carlos Ruiz. Every player featured in this 15-man roster took the field together in an official competitive match, a testament to their unity and tactical discipline. The victory not only secured a coveted title but also marked a defining moment in the club’s proud history, symbolizing the culmination of years of effort and excellence at one of the highest points of the team's identity."
