  "explanation": "The 2006 CAF Champions League Final remains one of Al Ahly's most defining moments in history. Under the guidance of coach Manuel José, this match showcased the club at its peak with a blend of defensive solidity and creative brilliance. Every starter – from the legendary Essam El-Hadary in goal to the clinical Tamer Sobhy up front – played together in one iconic performance against CS Sfaxien, a game that cemented Al Ahly's dominance in African football. The chosen starting XI and bench players represent a generation that not only won titles but also set the standard for excellence and unity at the club."
