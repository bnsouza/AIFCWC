  "explanation": "The 2018 CAF Champions League Final – and in particular the second-leg clash against Al Ahly – remains one of Espérance de Tunis’ most defining matches. In that high-pressure game, the team’s best‐ever lineup took the field in a 4-3-3 system to clinch the coveted title on the continent. With stalwarts like Ali Maâloul anchoring the defense and creative talents such as Youssef Msakni and Anice Badri spearheading the attack, every player on the day contributed to a performance that epitomized the club’s tactical acumen and competitive spirit. All these players shared the pitch in one official match, making this lineup not only a symbol of peak performance but also a historic moment in Espérance’s proud legacy."
