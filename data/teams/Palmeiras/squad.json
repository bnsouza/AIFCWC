  "explanation": "This lineup is taken from Palmeiras’ historic 2020 Copa Libertadores Final (played in February 2021), arguably one of the most significant matches in the club’s history. Under coach Abel Ferreira’s masterful guidance, the team deployed a balanced 4-2-3-1 formation featuring a rock-solid defensive quartet in Weverton, Marcos Rocha, Gustavo Gómez and Luan, with Mayke providing width on the left. The midfield duo of Danilo and Zé Rafael offered both defensive stability and transition play, while the attacking trio of Raphael Veiga, Dudu, and Rony created dynamic offensive opportunities. Luiz Adriano started as the lone striker, although the impact of substitute Breno Lopes (along with other bench members like Matías Viña, Patrick de Paula, Gustavo Scarpa and Egídio) was crucial in ensuring that all players shared the field in a match that encapsulated Palmeiras at its peak – clinching their second Copa Libertadores title and marking a defining moment in the club’s illustrious history."
