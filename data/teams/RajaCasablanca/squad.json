  "explanation": "The lineup presented above is based on Raja Casablanca’s most iconic night – the 1997 CAF Champions League final – a match that is etched in the club’s history. Under coach Fathi Jamal, this 4-3-3 formation featured a blend of experienced stalwarts and emerging talent. Legends such as Badou Zaki in goal, Abdelmajid Dolmy in midfield and Mustapha Hadji and Abdeljalil Hadda leading the attack were all on the field together, delivering one of the club’s finest performances on the continental stage. This match not only crowned Raja as African champions but also symbolized the peak of their footballing prowess, making this lineup a representation of the club’s golden era. The substitutes – carefully chosen from among club icons – provided depth and served as a contingency plan, further emphasizing the strength of the squad on that historic night."
