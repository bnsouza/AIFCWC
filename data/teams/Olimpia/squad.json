  "explanation": "The selected lineup is taken from Olimpia’s most iconic day—the 1979 Copa Libertadores final against Boca Juniors—which stands as the crowning achievement in the club’s history. Under the guidance of coach Luis Cubilla and arranged in a balanced 4-3-3 formation, the team combined a resolute defense anchored by Ever Hugo Almeida with creative and determined play in midfield and an attacking trio that overwhelmed their rivals. Every player in this roster was on the field together in that decisive match, and their performance not only secured Olimpia’s first Libertadores title but also set a benchmark of excellence for generations to come."
