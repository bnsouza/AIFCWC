    - The minimum number of players is 15, and the maximum is 20.
    - To each player, you must assign the position they played in that season.
    - Indicate the coach of the team.

    - \`CB\`: Center-back
    - \`RB\`: Right-back
    - \`LB\`: Left-back
    - \`CDM\`: Central defensive midfielder
