  "explanation": "The 2009 AFC Champions League campaign represents one of the most significant chapters in Pohang Steelers’ storied history. In the final – a high‐pressure, must‐win setting – Coach Hwang Sun-hong fielded this 4-2-3-1 lineup that perfectly balanced defensive solidity with creative and attacking flair. All 15 players (11 starters and 4 key substitutes) featured together in at least one official match during that campaign, epitomizing the club’s peak performance. Legends like Lee Dong-gook provided the cutting edge up front, while Choi Jin-cheul and the defensive unit ensured stability at the back. The midfield, anchored by Lee Gi-dong and Kim Kwang-min, orchestrated play and supplied quality service to creative outlets such as Song Chong-gug and Jung Dae-sung. This lineup not only showcased individual brilliance but also exemplified a cohesive team effort which, despite the final ultimately being decided on penalties, remains etched in the club’s legacy as a peak performance display on the continental stage."
