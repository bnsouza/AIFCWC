  "explanation": "The 2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final is one of Corinthians’ most iconic matches – a night when the club captured its first world title by defeating Chelsea in Yokohama. Under the masterful guidance of coach Tite, Corinthians deployed a disciplined 4-2-3-1 formation that balanced a sturdy defense (anchored by Fábio Santos, Chicão, Gil and Alessandro) with a hardworking midfield duo (Ralf and Paulinho) and a dynamic attacking trio (Danilo, Jorge Henrique and Romarinho), led by the talismanic striker Paolo Guerrero. Every one of these eleven players shared the pitch in that official final, a contest that remains a touchstone of peak performance and historical significance in the club’s modern era. To complete the matchday squad – all drawn from the same 2012 campaign – the substitutes included Igor (GK), Jádson (attacking midfielder), Renato (midfielder) and Maicon (defender), ensuring squad depth while preserving the legacy of that unforgettable night."
