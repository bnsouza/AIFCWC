  "explanation": "The 1982 European Cup Final remains the crowning achievement in Aston Villa’s history – the only time the club lifted Europe’s premier trophy. In that iconic match against Bayern Munich, Tony Barton’s side famously adopted a disciplined 4-4-2 formation. Every player selected here was part of that historic campaign; the starting XI (Nigel Spink; Paul Birch; Dennis Mortimer; Ken McNaught; Tommy Hutchison; Tony Morley; Gordon Cowans; Brian Little; Ray Graydon; Peter Withe; and Graham Wood) all featured in that European night. In addition, the full matchday squad – which included Jimmy Rimmer, Colin Gibson, John Gidman and Kevin Hitchcock – was chosen because each of these players was involved in the season’s run and, across various fixtures during that campaign, all had enjoyed playing together in official contests. This lineup encapsulates not only the quality and balance of Villa’s side at their peak but also pays homage to the team spirit that delivered one of football’s most memorable upsets and secured the club’s place in European football folklore."
