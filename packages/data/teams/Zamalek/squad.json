  "explanation": "The lineup above is taken from one of the club’s most iconic periods – the 2016 CAF Champions League final – a match that stands as a defining moment in Zamalek’s history. Under the tactical guidance of Cosmin Olăroiu, the team deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation that perfectly balanced defensive solidity and offensive creativity. Every one of the 15 players listed (11 starters and 4 substitutes) played together in that decisive final against Esperance Tunis, helping Zamalek to clinch the continental title. With legendary figures like Essam El-Hadary guarding the net, Ahmed Hegazi anchoring defence, the creative spark provided by Shikabala, and the clinical finishing of Mahmoud Kahraba, this lineup represents a peak in performance and unity – a team that not only won titles but also captured the hearts of fans across Egypt and Africa."
