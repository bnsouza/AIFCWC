  "explanation": "The 2012 Turkish Cup Final stands as one of Fenerbahçe’s most significant matches – a defining victory that cemented the club's status in modern Turkish football. This lineup is built entirely from players who featured together that day under coach Aykut Kocaman. It combines defensive solidity – anchored by longtime stalwarts Volkan Demirel, Gökhan Gönül, Diego Lugano and Servet Çetin – with a dynamic midfield duo in Mehmet Topal and Oğuzhan Özyakışık. The creative genius of Alex de Souza, whose vision and leadership symbolized an unforgettable era, provided the link to a potent attack spearheaded by Emir Bajrami and the clinical Semih Şentürk. Each of these players was at the peak of his powers in 2012 and all shared the field in that historic cup final, making this the best-ever Fenerbahçe lineup from one of the club’s defining European/Turkish encounters. Additionally, the bench – featuring Onur Kıvrak (GK), Moussa Sow (ST), Uche Okechukwu (wide role) and Ozan Tufan (defensive cover) – rounded out the squad, ensuring depth and talent were available when most needed."
