  "explanation": "The selected lineup is taken from one of Al-Merrikh’s most significant and memorable matches – the 1989 African Cup of Champions Clubs final. In that historic encounter against a formidable opponent, every player in this 4-3-3 formation played together in an official match, showcasing a rare blend of defensive solidity, midfield balance, and attacking dynamism. Coach Hussein Al-Sheikh’s tactical acumen ensured a cohesive performance, with the starting XI and substitutes all contributing to what is widely recognized as the peak era of Al-Merrikh’s club history. This match not only highlighted the club’s ability on the continental stage but also remains a defining moment in its storied legacy."
