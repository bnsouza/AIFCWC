  "explanation": "The 2013 UEFA Champions League Final stands as one of FC Bayern Munich’s most historically significant matches. In this iconic game at Wembley, Bayern reached their peak performance under coach Jupp Heynckes using a disciplined 4-3-3 formation that perfectly balanced defensive solidity, midfield creativity, and attacking prowess. The starting XI—featuring world-class players such as Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Dante, Jérôme Boateng, David Alaba, Javi Martínez, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Müller, Franck Ribéry, Arjen Robben, and Mario Mandžukić—delivered a masterclass in tactical organization and flair. Moreover, the bench players, including Toni Kroos (who made the crucial substitution for Javi Martínez), Holger Badstuber, Tom Starke, Xherdan Shaqiri, and Mario Gómez, were all integral parts of that match-day squad. Every member of this 16-man lineup shared the field or the dugout on that historic day, ensuring that the team’s spirit and talent were united in their ultimate triumph."
