  "explanation": "The 2012 UEFA Champions League Final is arguably the most significant match in Chelsea’s modern history. Under the management of Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea produced one of their finest performances by defeating Bayern Munich in a dramatic penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Every starting player – from Petr Čech’s organized goalkeeping to Didier Drogba’s heroic goal and penalty performance – played a pivotal role. This lineup not only epitomized tactical discipline with a 4-3-3 formation but also featured a blend of defensive solidity (Ivanović, Cahill, Terry, Cole), midfield mastery (Mikel, Lampard, Ramires) and attacking flair (Mata, Kalou, Drogba). The substitutes – Ross Turnbull, Yossi Benayoun, Gael Kakuta, and Jeffrey Bruma – were part of the official matchday squad, ensuring squad depth and strategic flexibility. All these players shared the pitch in that historic final, marking the pinnacle of Chelsea’s achievement in European competition."
