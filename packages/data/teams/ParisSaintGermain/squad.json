  "explanation": "The 2020 UEFA Champions League Final remains one of the most significant matches in Paris Saint-Germain’s history, as it marked the club’s first-ever appearance in the competition’s final and demonstrated the peak of their European ambitions. Under the guidance of coach Thomas Tuchel, this lineup featured a blend of defensive solidity with Marquinhos, Kimpembe, and a veteran Thiago Silva, while the midfield engine – led by Marco Verratti and Leandro Paredes – linked play to a dazzling attack spearheaded by Neymar, Kylian Mbappé, and Edinson Cavani. All 15 players (11 starters and 4 substitutes) were registered and present for the final, making this selection an authentic snapshot of PSG’s strongest team moment in 2020."
