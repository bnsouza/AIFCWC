  "explanation": "The lineup above represents one of the most iconic moments in TP Mazembe's history – the culminating match of their 2010 CAF Champions League campaign, played during the decisive second leg of the final in Lubumbashi. Under coach Lamine N'Diaye’s guidance and in a 4-3-3 formation, this team not only won Africa’s premier club competition but also paved the way for TP Mazembe’s historic run at the FIFA Club World Cup. Every player listed started or was on the bench during that official match, ensuring that all members shared the glory of a season in which the club reached its peak, uniting a generation of Congolese football talent on a truly continental stage."
