  "explanation": "This lineup represents the best-ever Colo-Colo team – the same eleven (plus key bench players) who took the field during the historic 1991 Copa Libertadores final, the only Libertadores title in the club’s illustrious history. Under coach Mirko Jozić and arranged in a 4-3-1-2 formation that balanced solidity in defence with creativity in midfield and potency in attack, each player was at the peak of his powers. Legends such as Patricio Yáñez, Marcelo Vega, and José Luis Sierra combined with inspirational figures like Ivo Basay and Eduardo Berizzo, forming a unit that not only secured Colo-Colo’s continental glory but also defined a generation of Chilean football excellence. Every player listed participated together in that decisive match, making this selection both historically authentic and emblematic of the club’s proud heritage."
