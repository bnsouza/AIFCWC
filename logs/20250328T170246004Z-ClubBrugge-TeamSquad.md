  "explanation": "The 1978 European Cup Final remains the most significant match in Club Brugge’s history – the day they reached the pinnacle of European club football by challenging Liverpool in one of the era’s most fiercely contested finals. Under the masterful guidance of Austrian coach Ernst Happel, this lineup featured several club legends who not only defined an era in Belgian football but also played together on that historic night. With Omer Van Maele guarding the goal; a defensive line marshalled by Eric Gerets, Hugo Broos, Willy Reynders and Raoul Lambert; a midfield engine centered on René Mertens and Frans De Voogt; and an attacking trio led by captain Jan Ceulemans flanked by wingers Roger Rijsbergen and Gérard Schrijvers with Alfons Moons as the main striker – every player contributed to a team performance that represented Club Brugge at its peak. The substitutes – Nico Van Leemput, Maurice Martens, Jan Matz and André Dierickx – were also part of that same historic squad, rounding out a roster in which every member had shared the undeniable pride of playing together in an official match at the highest level."
