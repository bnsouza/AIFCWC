  "explanation": "The lineup presented above draws from Celtic’s most celebrated team – the Lisbon Lions, who in 1967 became the first British side to win the European Cup. The 11 starters (Simpson; Craig, McNeill, Clark, Gemmell; Murdoch, Hughes, Wallace; Johnstone, Lennox, Chalmers) took the field in that historic final using a 4-3-3 formation, epitomizing a blend of solid defence, ingenious midfield play and incisive attacking flair. Although substitutions were not used in the final due to the rules of the era, four key members from the broader Lisbon Lions squad – Fallon, Connelly, Stanton and Diver – were later featured in official matches during that European Cup campaign. This full complement of 15 players, all of whom played together at least once in competitive action, encapsulates a golden era for Celtic under Jock Stein and remains synonymous with the club’s peak performance in European competition."
