In a 4-2-4 formation that exemplified the attacking flair and tactical innovation of the era, the starting XI featured world‐class talents such as Pelé, Coutinho and Pepe, supported by the industrious Zito and Mengálvio in midfield, while a solid defensive line anchored by Mauro Ramos, Menecão, Zequinha and Arouca ensured balance. Coach Lula’s leadership helped the team secure a defining victory that not only brought major international silverware to the club but also established Santos as a powerhouse in world football. The substitutes—José Henrique, Oscar, Toninho Guerreiro and Liro—were key squad members, rounding out a roster of 15 players who all shared the field in that historic contest."
