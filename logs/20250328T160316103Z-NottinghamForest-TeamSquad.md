  "explanation": "The 1979 European Cup Final stands as the most significant moment in Nottingham Forest's storied history – a game that saw the club achieve European glory at the peak of its powers. Managed by Brian Clough, this lineup featured legends who played together in that iconic clash against Malmö. With Peter Shilton guarding the goal; a back‐line of Viv Anderson, Larry Lloyd, John McGovern, and John O’Hare providing a rock‐solid defense; a midfield trio of Peter Ward, Ian Bowyer and a wide contribution from Martin O’Neill and John Robertson; and the striking partnership of Trevor Francis and Garry Birtles delivering the decisive edge – every player played a pivotal role in securing Forest’s first-ever European Cup. The substitutes, including John Middleton, Frank Clark, Alan Hinton, and John Gamble, were all part of the same matchday squad, thereby ensuring that every member selected had been on the field together in official competition during that historic season."
