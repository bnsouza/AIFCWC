Provide the following details for the football club named Monterrey (Mexico - CONCACAF):
- Foundation date
- City
- Full name
- Short name

- Social media handles (Instagram and TikTok)

**Additional guidelines:**
- The first color set must represent the club’s primary (home) kit.
- The second set should represent the away kit.
- If the club has a third (alternate) kit in its history or current use, include that as a third option.
- All colors must be based on the actual club kit used historically or currently. Do not invent combinations.
