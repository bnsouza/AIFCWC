    "explanation": "The 2008 Copa Libertadores final stands as the most significant game in LDU Quito’s history – their landmark triumph as the first Ecuadorian club to win CONMEBOL’s premier tournament. Under coach Edgardo Bauza’s meticulous guidance, the team employed a 4-2-3-1 formation that perfectly balanced defensive solidity with inventive attacking flair. Every player in this lineup not only had the honor of starting in that historic final, but they also had shared minutes on the pitch throughout the campaign. Icons such as captain Patricio Urrutia, creative force Édison Méndez, dynamic winger Joffre Guerrón, and clinical striker Claudio Bieler – alongside teammates Víctor Barboza and Alejandro Kenig in the attacking trio – helped forge an unforgettable side that peaked at the very moment the nation watched in awe. The substitutes, including José Luis Sánchez, Mauro Andrade, Diego Calderón, and a young Jaime Ayoví, were also integral members of that cohesive squad, ready to contribute when called upon. This lineup not only represents the best eleven ever fielded by LDU Quito but also a unique convergence of talent that played together in one of the defining matches in the club’s history."
