    "explanation": "The 1966 European Cup Final – the pinnacle of FK Partizan’s history – saw the club reach the final against Real Madrid. This match represents an era when Partizan’s distinctive style and tactical discipline were on full display, with a starting XI featuring legends such as Milutin Šoškić in goal, Velibor Vasović, Fahrudin Jusufi, and Zvezdan Čebinac anchoring the defence, and Milan Galić spearheading the attack. Although the rules then did not allow any substitutions during the game, the official matchday registration comprised a 15‐man squad. These additional players—Sava Antić, Branislav Janković, Marko Nikolić, and Radomir Vasiljević—were integral members of that golden campaign and later featured in other official fixtures alongside the starters. Together they formed a unit that reached unprecedented heights, and this lineup is celebrated not only for its near-miraculous run in Europe but also for laying the foundation of Partizan’s enduring legacy."
