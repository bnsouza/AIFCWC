  "explanation": "The 1996 UEFA Champions League Final is one of Juventus’ most iconic matches. Under Marcello Lippi’s guidance, the club fielded a team packed with world‐class talent at their peak – a lineup that featured established stars such as Peruzzi, Montero, Ferrara, and Torricelli in defense; a dynamic and inventive midfield built around Di Livio, Conte, Deschamps, Tacchinardi, and Pessotto; and a potent strike partnership in Del Piero and Ravanelli. Despite ultimately losing to Ajax on penalties, the performance in this match epitomized Juventus’ tactical brilliance and quality during that era. All the players listed not only featured together on the day but also represent one of the highest peaks in the club’s long and storied history."
