```
Provide the following details for the football club named Nacional (Uruguay - CONMEBOL):
- Foundation date
- City
- Full name
- Short name
- Stadium name and capacity
- Social media handles (Instagram and TikTok)
- Colors: generate up to 3 distinct uniform color combinations for the team. Each color set must include:
  - Background color (based on shirt color)
  - Font color (used for numbers and names)

**Additional guidelines:**
- The first color set must represent the clubâ€™s primary (home) kit.
- The second set should represent the away kit.
- If the club has a third (alternate) kit in its history or current use, include that as a third option.
- All colors must be based on the actual club kit used historically or currently. Do not invent combinations.
- For each color set, ensure that the contrast ratio between background and font color is at least 4.5:1 for screen readability.
- Convert the colors to their most precise representation using the CSS 'rgb()' function format.
- Do not use color names like "blue" or "red"; always provide actual color values.
