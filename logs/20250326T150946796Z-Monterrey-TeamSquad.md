  "explanation": "This lineup is based on Monterrey's peak performance during the 2012 CONCACAF Champions League Final – one of the most significant games in the club's history. Under the tactical guidance of coach Víctor Manuel Vucetich and deployed in a classic 4-4-2 system, the team fielded a starting XI featuring stalwarts like Diego Reyes in goal, a defensively solid backline with Héctor Moreno and Carlos Salcido, and a dynamic midfield anchored by Jesús Guardado and Adrián Aldrete. Up front, the prolific striking duo of Humberto Suazo and Aldo de Nigris led the charge. All of these players not only shared the pitch in that iconic final but also contributed to establishing Monterrey as a continental powerhouse. The substitutes – Marco Pérez, Daniel Corrales, Jonathan Rodríguez, Víctor Ruiz, and Víctor Carlos Ramos – round out a squad that was depth‐charged and battle-hardened, making this the best-ever ever lineup for the club."
