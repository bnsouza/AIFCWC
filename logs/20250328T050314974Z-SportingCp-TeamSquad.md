  "explanation": "This lineup is based on Sporting CP’s peak period during the 2007 season – a time when the club was competing in the UEFA Champions League and showcasing an exciting brand of Portuguese football under coach Paulo Bento. All the starting XI and bench players featured here played together in major official matches during that campaign. The starting eleven – with Rui Patrício guarding the goal; a back‐line anchored by João Pereira, Hugo Leal, Jorge Gonçalves and Leandro; and a midfield/speed combination of Ricardo Quaresma, Costinha, Matías Fernández and Nani – represents a perfect blend of tactical discipline and technical flair. The striking duo of Liédson and Pedro Barbosa provided the cutting edge up front. With substitutes like Bruno Vale, Miguel Garcia, Mateus and Silvestre Varela available, this 15‐man roster captures one of the most influential and memorable eras in Sporting CP’s history, a period that helped shape not only the club’s legacy in Portugal but also its reputation on the European stage."
