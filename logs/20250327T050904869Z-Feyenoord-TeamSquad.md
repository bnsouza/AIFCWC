  "explanation": "The 1970 European Cup Final is arguably Feyenoord’s most iconic match – not only did they become the first Dutch club to win Europe’s premier club competition, but they did so against a formidable Celtic side. Under the masterful guidance of coach Ernst Happel, the starting XI featured legends such as goalkeeper Eddy Pieters Graafland, creative midfielders Willem van Hanegem and Wim Jansen, and attacking wingers Coen Moulijn and Henk Groot – capped by the clinical finishing of Ove Kindvall. This lineup, with all players having shared the field in that definitive final, represents the peak of Feyenoord’s historical performance and embodies the club’s fighting spirit and technical excellence."
