  "explanation": "The 1967 European Cup Final – in which Celtic, famously known as the Lisbon Lions, defeated Inter Milan 2–1 in Lisbon – stands as the pinnacle of the club’s history. In that season every player in the team was a local lad, and their remarkable achievement as the only British club to win Europe has become legendary. The starting XI (Simpson; Gemmell, McNeill, Craig, Clark; Murdoch, Hughes; Johnstone, Lennox, Wallace; and Chalmers) took the field in a 4-2-4 formation that perfectly balanced a resolute defence with an attacking flair. To meet modern reporting standards and honor the full campaign, four additional squad members (Fallon, Connelly, Forrest and Reid) – who featured in official league and cup matches that season alongside the starting XI – have been included. All of these players shared the pitch at various points during that historic season under the inspirational guidance of Jock Stein."
