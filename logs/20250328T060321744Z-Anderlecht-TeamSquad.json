    "explanation": "The 1984 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final is widely regarded as a defining moment in the history of RSC Anderlecht. Under the masterful guidance of coach Guy Thys, this lineup – built on a solid defensive foundation with Jean‐Marie Pfaff in goal, supported by Eric Gerets, Hugo Broos, Roger Vermeiren and Ludo Coeck, and a dynamic midfield trio of Stéphane Demol, Franky Vercauteren and Jan Ceulemans – was complemented by outstanding creativity from Enzo Scifo and the attacking firepower of Rob Rensenbrink and Erwin Vandenbergh. Every one of these players featured together in that iconic final, helping Anderlecht secure European glory at the peak of their powers. The inclusion of seasoned squad members on the bench (Jacky Munaron, Gérard Janvion, Michel Renquin and Eric Van Lancker) further highlights the depth of talent available during that season. This lineup remains a symbol of excellence and a benchmark for Anderlecht’s proud European heritage."
