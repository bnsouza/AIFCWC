    "explanation": "The 1995 UEFA Champions League Final remains one of AFC Ajax’s most iconic matches – a game where a young, dynamic, and tactically innovative side triumphed over a footballing giant in AC Milan. Under Louis van Gaal’s masterful guidance, Ajax deployed a 3-5-2 formation that not only emphasized a rock‐solid defense – with Blind, de Boer, and Reiziger – but also a fluid midfield and a potent attack featuring Litmanen and a clinical Kluivert. Every player in this lineup was part of that historic matchday squad, making this selection a perfect representation of Ajax’s golden era and peak performance in European club football."
