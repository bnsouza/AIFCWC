  "explanation": "The 1979 European Cup Final stands as the defining moment in Nottingham Forest’s history. This lineup – featuring legends like Peter Shilton, Viv Anderson, and the dynamic forward pairing of Garry Birtles and Tony Woodcock – represents the peak of Forest’s golden era under Brian Clough. In one of the most significant matches in European football, each of these players took to the field together, with substitutes such as Trevor Francis (whose memorable impact off the bench helped cement the victory) rounding out the squad. Their collective performance in that iconic 4-4-2 formation not only secured the club’s first European Cup but also etched their names permanently into football history."
