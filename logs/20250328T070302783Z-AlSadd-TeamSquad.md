  "explanation": "The chosen lineup is based on the iconic AFC Champions League quarter‐final match in 2018 – a game that is widely remembered as one of Al Sadd’s most significant displays of quality and unity. At that peak, the club combined world‐class international talent with its homegrown stars. Legendary playmaker Xavi Hernández orchestrated the midfield alongside domestic dynamo Hassan Al Haydos and creative Abdelkarim Hassan, while the attacking force of Baghdad Bounedjah, Joffre Guerrón and Mohamed Afif consistently troubled opposition defenses. Defensively, players like Abdelaziz Al-Baloushi, Abdulrahman Al-Ali and Mohammed Abdulqadir provided solidity, backed up by dependable cover from Hassan Hamad. The substitutes – Ahmed Al-Ansari, Mutaz Abdelrahman, Abdelrahman Al-Obaid and Mohammed Muntari – all featured in official competitions alongside the starters during that season. Under coach Jesualdo Ferreira, this 2018 outfit not only delivered a memorable continental performance but also epitomized the tactical and technical excellence that has come to define Al Sadd’s illustrious history."
