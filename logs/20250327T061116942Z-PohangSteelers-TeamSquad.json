This lineup, fielded by coach Kim Ho in a 4-4-2 formation, perfectly blended experience and emerging talent. Veterans like Hong Myung-bo and Lee Young-pyo provided rock-solid defensive leadership, while dynamic midfielders such as Shin Tae-yong and Choi Sung-yong controlled the engine room. Up front, the lethal striking partnership of Lee Dong-gook and Hwang Sun-hong epitomized Pohang’s attacking flair. Each player was on the field together during that landmark match, representing the club at its peak and highlighting an era that not only won titles but also inspired a generation of fans and future footballers in South Korea."
