### 2.2 Role-Specific Attributes (By Position)

Wingers are evaluated based on their ability to beat defenders (`dribbling`) and deliver decisive plays (`keyPass`). Attributes like `reflexes`, `oneOnOnes`, or `aerialDuels` represent critical moments that may change the course of a match.

Each player has two additional attributes based on their primary position, adding differentiation and tactical depth. These attributes are carefully chosen to reflect key traits that can impact match outcomes and player interactions on the pitch.
