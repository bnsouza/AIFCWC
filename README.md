# AIFCWC ‚Äì AI Football Club World Cup

Welcome to the **AIFCWC**: a fictional football tournament that brings together the greatest club teams of all time in a single, epic cup. This project is a fun, creative experiment to imagine what would happen if legends from different eras and styles clashed on the pitch.

## ‚öΩ What is AIFCWC?

The **AI Football Club World Cup** is a simulated competition between iconic football teams, each chosen from the peak of their historic dominance. Think 2009 Barcelona vs 1970 Santos, or 1999 Manchester United facing off against 1989 AC Milan.

We aim to answer the ultimate "what if" of football history ‚Äî through storytelling, match reports, tactics breakdowns, and even fantasy-like interactions between players and coaches from different generations.

## üèüÔ∏è How the Cup Works

- **Tournament Format:** A league + knockout hybrid. All teams play each other in a group stage, with the best advancing to the knockout rounds.
- **Team Selection:** Only the best version of each club is allowed ‚Äî no duplicates from different years.
- **Match Simulation:** Results are based on a mix of data, narrative design, tactical analysis, and a bit of football magic.
- **Extra Features:**
  - Injuries, form, and fatigue will affect performance.
  - Coaches and bench players play a strategic role.
  - Matches are hosted in iconic stadiums with real-life weather conditions taken into account.
  - Between-match events such as interviews, training clashes, and mystical "dream encounters" among players (imagine Zico and Beckham trading free kicks with Juninho Pernambucano).

## üìΩÔ∏è Storytelling & Media

Stay tuned for:

- Match highlights and reports
- Tactical deep dives
- Fictional player and coach interactions
- Audience polls and fan debates
